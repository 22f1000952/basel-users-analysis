# Basel GitHub User Analysis

- **How we collected the data**: We used the GitHub API to scrape all users in Basel with more than 10 followers, along with their repositories.
- **Interesting finding**: A large portion of hireable users do not provide their emails publicly.
- **Recommendation for developers**: A complete profile with public projects and bios can attract more followers.
